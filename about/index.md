<center><b>CropShare</b> is an intelligent marketplace linking farmers and value added producers with consumers.</center>

We define a <b>share</b> as a stake in an individual or small business that, unlike traditional shares in equity markets, yields the owner a bounty of tangible goods on a regular basis.  Our system is designed around the traditional model for community supported agriculture, wherein customers interested in receiving a weekly or bi-weekly bounty of vegetables and other farm products, signs up, pre-pays, and becomes a member of said farms CSA (cropshare) program.  Most often, sign ups happen before produce is readily available and in purchasing a share, the customer is helping support the farm (whose overhead is highest early in the season).  The farm, who we will call the producer, sets a start date and ultimately provides this bounty at regular time increments as set forth by the terms.


<b>OUR MISSION:</b>  To help create a sustainable food system across the globe and serve as an agricultural resource connecting farms and value added producers with consumers.  We strive to bring the magic of community supported agriculture and nutritious food to more people.  We will invest a portion of our proceeds to assist limited-income families in accessing to our shares.  


<b>Why sell with cropshare?</b> No matter how complex your CSA program is, Cropshare makes it simple and secure to manage, market, and earn money from selling your shares.  We help farmers and value added producers reach millions of potential customers consumers to increase your share membership and help you earn more.  

<b>Youâ€™re in charge.</b>  With Cropshare, you are in full control of your share prices, availability, pickup and delivery logistics, and your interactions with your members.  You can structure your shares and handle the process however you please.  

<b>We are here to help.</b>  Cropshare provides tools, advice, support, and an online community of experienced producers for questions and sharing ideas for success.   

<b>Free for farmers.</b>  We will never charge farmers or food producers for using our platform.  The system is supported by a small fee levied against the shareholders.
